BACKGROUND and NOTES
====================
This module started by using wsdl2perl.pl for generating supporting
modules.  Below is an example of the command line used and some
additional details about the arguments used in the command:

  .../bin/wsdl2perl.pl \
    -a ZCS::Admin::Attributes \
    -t ZCS::Admin::Types \
    -e ZCS::Admin::Elements \
    -m ZCS::Admin::Typemaps \
    -i ZCS::Admin::Interfaces \
    -sp ZCS::Admin::Server \
    -mi .../zcs-admin-custom-typemap.pl \
    file:.../ZimbraAdmin.wsdl

Where:
- .../bin/wsdl2perl.pl :: utility provided by SOAP::WSDL
- .../zcs-admin-custom-typemap.pl :: (typemap) hash to map types to
  modules that wsdl2perl.pl did not handle
- .../ZimbraAdmin.wsdl :: WSDL that describes some (but not yet all)
  of the ZCS Admin SOAP API capabilities
